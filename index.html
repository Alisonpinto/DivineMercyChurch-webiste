                Leaving the house of Caiaphas, where he had been blasphemed, and the house of Herod, where he had been mocked, Jesus is dragged before Pilate, his back torn with scourges, his head crowned with thorns; and he, who on the last day will judge the living and the dead, is himself condemned to a disgraceful death.

            <p> <u><b>Prayer</b></u>:</p>
            <p>It was for us that You did suffer, O Blessed Jesus. It was for our sins that You were condemned to die. Oh, grant that we may detest our sins from the bottom of our hearts, and obtain your mercy and pardon by repentance.</p>

                Bowed down under the weight of the cross, Jesus slowly sets forth on the way to calvary, amidst the mockeries and insults of the crowd. His agony in the garden has exhausted his body.

                Still burdened with the cross, and wounded yet more by his fall, Jesus proceeds on His way. He is met by his loving mother. What a meeting must have that been! What a sword of anguish must have pierced the mother's heart! What must have been the compassion of that Son for his holy mother!
            </p>
            <p> <u><b>Prayer</b></u>:</p>
            <p>O Jesus, by the compassion which You did feel for Your Mother, have compassion on us, and give us a share in her intercession. O Mary, most afflicted mother, intercede for us that, though the sufferings of your Son, we may be delivered from eternal death.</p>

                As the strength of Jesus fails, and he is unable to proceed, The executioners seize and compel Simon of Cyrene to carry His cross. The grace of that cross changes the Cryrenean's heart and from the compulsory task, it becomes a privilege and joy.
            </p>

                As Jesus proceeds along the way covered with the sweat of blood, a woman, moved with compassion, makes her way through the crowd, and wipes his face with a handkerchief. As a reward for her piety, the impression of His sacred countenance is miraculously imprinted upon the handkerchief. </p>

                At the sight of the sufferings of Jesus, some holy women in the crowd were so touched with sympathy that they openly bewailed and lamented for Him.

                So let us trust him for in him is mercy;
                He, the Lord, is kind.
                He gives us pardon, generous redemption
                Casts our sins behind.

                Heavenly Father, we have contemplated your Son, Jesus, on his Way of the Cross, in his Spirit which you have gifted to us. We accept our way of the cross. We know it will lead us to, where it led him to, our resurrection with him. We thank You for the joy of this vision of faith. 
                For the intention of the Holy Father,
            </p>
