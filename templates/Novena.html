    <p><strong>All:</strong> My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord, my spirit finds joy in God my savior; 
      for he has looked upon His servant in her lowliness; all ages to come shall call me blessed. 
      God who is mighty has done great things for me, holy is His name; His mercy is from age to age on those who fear Him. 
      He has shown might with His arm; He has confused the proud in their inmost thoughts. 
      He has deposed the mighty from their thrones and raised the lowly to high places. 
      The hungry He has given every good thing, while the rich He has sent empty away. 
      He has upheld Israel his servant, ever mindful of His mercy; Even as He promised our fathers, 
      promised Abraham and His descendants forever. Amen.

        <p><strong>A Prayer to Mother Mary in time of trouble</strong></p>
        <p><strong>All:</strong>Vouchsafe that I may praise thee, O sacred Virgin; give me strength against thine enemies, and against the enemy of the whole human race. Give me strength humbly to pray to thee. Give me strength to praise thee in prayer with all my powers, through the merits of thy most sacred nativity, which for the entire Christian world was a birth of joy, the hope and solace of its life. When thou wast born, O most holy Virgin then was the world made light. Happy is thy stock, holy thy root, and blessed thy fruit, for thou alone as a virgin, filled with the Holy Spirit, didst merit to conceive thy God, as a virgin to bear Thy God, as a virgin to bring Him forth, and after His birth to remain a virgin. Have mercy therefore upon me a sinner, and give me aid, O Lady, so that just as thy nativity, glorious from the seed of Abraham, sprung from the tribe of Judah, illustrious from the stock of David, didst announce joy to the entire world, so may it fill me with true joy and cleanse me from every sin. Pray for me, O Virgin most prudent, that the gladsome joys of thy most helpful nativity may put a cloak over all my sins. O holy Mother of God, flowering as the lily, pray to thy sweet Son for me, a wretched sinner. Amen</p>
        <p><strong>Leader:</strong> Mary Queen of heaven,</p>
        <p><strong>All:</strong> Pray for us!</p>
